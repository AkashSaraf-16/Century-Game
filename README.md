# Century-Game
Just a simple game nbuild using HTML,CSS and Javascript.
Rules of game are pretty simple:
1. It is a 2 player game
2. each player gets a chance to roll the dice starting from player 1.
3. player has 2 choice either to roll the dice or hold the current score so that it can be added to his total score and now the other player will get chance.
4. in between if any player gets 1 while rolling his current score will be become 0 and the chance will be given to the other player.
5. the one to reach 100 first will win
6. Enjoying playing ;)
